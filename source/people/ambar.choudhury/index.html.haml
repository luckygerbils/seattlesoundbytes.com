      Ambar Choudhury (<span class="part" itemprop="title">Vocal Percussion / Bass</span>)
      is a multi-talented, multi-Lingual CS major from UW. He tries to incorporate 
      his diverse musical tastes, ranging from Indian classical music to heavy rock 
      into his compositions for SoundBYTES. A fan of the late Bernie Mac, Ambar
      brings a baritone voice and the beats that keep the songs moving.
