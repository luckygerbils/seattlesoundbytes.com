    %p
      Sean (<span class="part" itemprop="title">Baritone/Bass</span>) works as a Software
      Developer, and graduated from UW in 2010. An avid reader, Sean still makes time
      for biking and website building. When asked his favorite color, Sean will respond
      with <span style="color:#3e4f60">"#3e4f60"</span> which is supposedly blue-gray-green (computer science...). He made
      this website! As the bass of the group, Sean is our rock!
